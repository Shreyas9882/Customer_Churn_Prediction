Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue their telecom services (churn). The application leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on a structured telecom dataset and employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance. This system enables telecom service providers to proactively identify high-risk customers and take targeted actions to retain them.
The project is developed using Python for the backend, scikit-learn for machine learning, and Streamlit for building a lightweight and interactive user interface.

Problem Statement

Customer retention is a critical aspect of business growth in the telecom industry. Acquiring new customers often incurs higher costs than retaining existing ones. However, identifying customers likely to churn is a complex task due to the non-linear relationships between factors like demographics, usage patterns, billing behavior, and customer support interactions.

This project aims to address the problem by:

  1. Applying machine learning techniques to detect patterns in customer behavior.

  2. Creating a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

  3. Using SMOTE to address the class imbalance problem, which is common in churn datasets.

Project Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue their telecom services (churn). The application leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on a structured telecom dataset and employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance. This system enables telecom service providers to proactively identify high-risk customers and take targeted actions to retain them.
The project is developed using Python for the backend, scikit-learn for machine learning, and Streamlit for building a lightweight and interactive user interface.
